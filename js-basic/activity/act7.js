// EXERCISES

// 1) Create a class Vehicle that

// A) have as prop an array of passengers -
// B) have as prop an object named rules that contains the props: maxSpeed and maxPassengers -
// C) create a constructor to fulfill these props you created (passengers and rules) -
// D) create a function getMaxSpeed() that returns the maxSpeed of the vehicle (use the same maxSpeed you fulfilled on the constructor)
// E) create a function getMaxPassengers() that returns the maxPassengers of the vehicle (again, use the same maxPassengers you fulfilled on the constructor)

class Vehicle {
  passengers = ["Ian", "Jonatan", "Maria", "JoÃ£o"];
  rules = [(maxSpeed = 50), (maxPassengers = 10)];

  maxSpeed;
  maxPassengers;

  constructor(passengers, rules) {
    this.passengers = passengers;
    this.rules = rules;
  }

  getMaxSpeed() {
    return this.maxSpeed;
  }

  getMasPassengers() {
    return this.maxPassengers;
  }
}

// 2) Create a class Bus that

// A) have fuelType as prop
// B) extends Vehicle
// C) fulfill the props from the inherited class and the props of the Bus class
// D) overwrite the functions from the parent class and do the same as you did on exercises 1 D and E, but now return the speed in MPH, not in KM/H
// E) create a function called getFuelType() that returns the fuelType you fulfilled on the constructor
// F) create a function addPassenger(passenger) that adds one new passanger to the array of passangers (remember you extended this array fro the vehicle class)
// G) create a function removePassenger(passenger) that removes one passenger from the Bus by name!

// Tip: the passengers array should look something like => ["Ian", "Joao", "Pedro", "Ana"]

class Bus extends Vehicle {
  fueltype;

  constructor(passengers, rules) {
    this.passengers = passengers;
    this.rules = rules;
  }
}
